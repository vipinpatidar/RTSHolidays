# Use the official Node.js 20-alpine as a base image
# Stage 1: Build the frontend
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-alpine AS frontend-build

# Set working directory for frontend
WORKDIR /frontend

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json for frontend
COPY ./frontend/package*.json ./

# Install frontend dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the frontend source code
COPY ./frontend ./

# Build the frontend for production
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Set up the backend with frontend build
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-alpine

# Set working directory for backend
WORKDIR /app

# Copy backend package files
COPY ./backend/package*.json ./

# Install backend dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy backend source code to /app
COPY ./backend ./

# Copy the frontend build files from Stage 1 to /frontend/dist
WORKDIR /
COPY --from=frontend-build /frontend/dist /frontend/dist

# Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm run build

# Expose backend port (default to 3000)
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the backend server
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]

```

#### add a .env file in frontend directory with environment variables like

      #VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
      #VITE_STRIPE_PUB_KEY=your cloudinary cloud name

#### add a .env file in the backend directory with environment variables like

      #PORT=3000
      #MONGODB_URL=your mongodb url
      #ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET= your access token secret
      #REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET= your refresh token secret
      #NODE_ENV= development
      #FRONTEND_URL = http://localhost:5173

    # establish docker compose watch mode for the backend service
    develop:

      watch:
        # it'll watch for changes in package.json and package-lock.json and rebuild the container and image if there are any changes
        - path: ./backend/package.json

        - path: ./backend/package-lock.json
          action: rebuild

  # define the db service
  db:
    # specify the image to use for the db service from docker hub. If we have a custom image, we can specify that in this format
    # In the above two services, we're using the build context to build the image for the service from the Dockerfile so we specify the image as "build: ./frontend" or "build: ./backend".
    # but for the db service, we're using the image from docker hub so we specify the image as "image: mongo:latest"
    # you can find the image name and tag for mongodb from docker hub here: https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo
    image: mongo:latest

    # specify the ports to expose for the db service
    # generally, we do this in backend service using mongodb atlas. But for demo purposes, we're using a local mongodb instance
    # usually, mongodb runs on port 27017. So we're exposing the port 27017 on the host machine and mapping it to the port 27017 inside the container
    ports:
      - 27017:27017

    # specify the volumes to mount for the db service
    # we're mounting the volume named "hotelDB" inside the container at /data/db directory
    # this is done so that the data inside the mongodb container is persisted even if the container is stopped
    volumes:
      - hotelDB:/data/db

# define the volumes to be used by the services
volumes:
  hotelDB:

```

5. Start the backend server:npm run dev

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   cd RTSHolidays/frontend

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
